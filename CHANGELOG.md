### Pending Refactoring Tasks
Based on `ISSUE_PANDAS_REFACTOR.md` and `REFACTORING_GUIDE.md`, the following pandas operations are identified for future centralization:

#### High Priority (Next Phase)
- `clean_columns()` - Column cleaning and standardization
- `convert_data_types()` - Data type conversion and validation  
- `remap_country_codes()` - Advanced country code processing
- `process_energy_data()` - Energy-specific data transformations

#### Medium Priority
- Advanced data validation rules
- Performance optimization for large datasets
- Caching layer for frequently loaded data
- Database connectivity options

#### Low Priority  
- Async/parallel processing support
- Real-time data streaming capabilities
- Advanced analytics helpers

### Architecture Notes
```
Current Architecture (Implemented):
utils/helpers.py     → Basic data operations (load, merge, rename)
utils/mapping.py     → Constants and mappings (energy types, countries, columns)
utils/flags.py       → Country flag utilities (add_country_flags, get_flag_url)
data/loader.py       → Refactored to use centralized helpers
data/filters.py      → Refactored to use centralized helpers

Future Architecture (Planned):
utils/helpers.py     → Extended with all pandas operations
utils/validation.py  → Data validation and quality checks
utils/performance.py → Performance optimization utilities
```

├── load_csv_data()              # Basic CSV loading
├── load_gdf()                   # GeoDataFrame loading  
├── merge_data()                 # Data merging
└── rename_columns()             # Column standardization

utils/mapping.py
├── ENERGY_TYPE_MAPPING          # Energy type code mappings
├── COUNTRY_CODE_MAPPING         # Country code standardization
├── EU_COUNTRIES                 # EU member countries set
└── COLUMN_MAPPING               # Column renaming mappings
```

#### Module Dependencies Established
```
data/loader.py    → begins using utils/helpers.py + utils/mapping.py
data/filters.py   → begins using utils/mapping.py

utils/mapping.py  → new (data mapping constants and functions)
```

#### Backward Compatibility Maintained
- All existing function signatures remain unchanged
- `load_data()` function maintains same API
- No breaking changes to existing codebase

## [1.0.0] - Previous Release

### Summary
Initial implementation with basic functionality before refactoring.

### Features
- Basic data loading with direct pandas operations
- Simple filtering and preprocessing functions
- Minimal test structure
- Inline data mappings and transformations

### Known Issues
- Code duplication across modules
- No centralized error handling
- Limited test coverage  
- Inline mappings scattered throughout codebase

---

**Note**: The refactoring maintains full backward compatibility while establishing the foundation for improved code organization, testability, and maintainability. All current functionality continues to work exactly as before, with the added benefit of centralized utilities and comprehensive testing.
